from real_estate_analytics import *
```

### Basic Usage

```python
# 1. Create a client profile
client = Client(
    name="Your Real Estate Company",
    location="Your City",
    business_type="Consumer Products"
)

# 2. Create a service provider
provider = ServiceProvider(
    name="Analytics Expert",
    title="Data Analyst",
    company="Analytics Co"
)

# 3. Create a service request
service_request = ServiceRequest(
    client=client,
    service_type=ServiceType.BUSINESS_ANALYTICS,
    project_type=ProjectType.ONE_TIME
)

# 4. Set up data platform
data_platform = DataPlatform("MyAnalytics", "./data")
data_platform.create_sample_data()  # Generate sample data

# 5. Set up KPI management
kpi_manager = KPIManager(data_platform)
kpi_results = kpi_manager.calculate_all_kpis()

# 6. Create dashboards
dashboard_builder = DashboardBuilder(data_platform, kpi_manager)
dashboard_builder.run_dashboard("executive")  # Run interactive dashboard
```

## Complete Example

## Key Components

### 1. Service Request Management

Handle the complete service request lifecycle from creation to completion:

```python
# Create and manage service requests
service_request = ServiceRequest(
    client=client,
    service_type=ServiceType.BUSINESS_ANALYTICS,
    project_type=ProjectType.ONE_TIME,
    deadline=datetime.now() + timedelta(days=7)  # This week deadline
)

# Assign provider and track progress
service_request.assign_provider(provider)
service_request.update_progress(50, "Data platform setup completed")
```

### 2. Data Platform Setup

Set up a comprehensive data platform tailored to your business:

```python
# Create data platform
platform = DataPlatform("RealEstateAnalytics", "./data")

# Add data sources
platform.add_data_source(
    name="property_database",
    source_type="database",
    connection_string="sqlite:///properties.db"
)

# Generate sample data for testing
sample_data = platform.create_sample_data()
```

### 3. KPI Management

Track key business metrics relevant to real estate operations:

```python
# Set up KPI management
kpi_manager = KPIManager(data_platform)

# Calculate all KPIs
kpi_results = kpi_manager.calculate_all_kpis()

# Get KPI dashboard data
dashboard_data = kpi_manager.get_kpi_dashboard()
```

### 4. A/B Testing

Design and run A/B tests with statistical analysis:

```python
# Create A/B test manager
ab_manager = ABTestManager()

# Create test from template
pricing_test = ab_manager.create_test_from_template(
    "pricing_strategy",
    hypothesis="Premium pricing will generate higher revenue"
)

# Start test and add data
pricing_test.start_test()
pricing_test.add_data_point("Market Price", converted=True, value=500000)

# Get results with statistical analysis
results = pricing_test.get_current_results()
```

### 5. Data Analysis

Comprehensive analysis capabilities:

```python
# Create data analyzer
analyzer = DataAnalyzer(data_platform)

# Market trends analysis
market_trends = analyzer.analyze_market_trends()

# Property performance analysis
property_performance = analyzer.analyze_property_performance()

# Investment analysis
investment_analysis = analyzer.generate_investment_analysis({
    'purchase_price': 500000,
    'monthly_rent': 2500,
    'annual_expenses': 10000
})

# Create comprehensive market report
report_path = analyzer.create_market_report()
```

### 6. Dashboard Creation

Create interactive dashboards and visualizations:

```python
# Create dashboard builder
dashboard_builder = DashboardBuilder(data_platform, kpi_manager, analyzer)

# Run different types of dashboards
dashboard_builder.run_dashboard("executive")    # Executive dashboard
dashboard_builder.run_dashboard("property")     # Property analysis
dashboard_builder.run_dashboard("rental")       # Rental analytics

# Generate charts
chart_generator = ChartGenerator(data_platform)
price_chart = chart_generator.create_price_trend_chart()
performance_chart = chart_generator.create_property_performance_chart()
```
